# What's this?
It's a really simple chatting application made in Node.js, by default, it opens a webserver on port 8080, which you can connect to with a regular web browser. You are then prompted to provide a username, after doing this, you'll be able to read previously sent messages as well as send new ones. In theory the server can handle a somewhat-high quantity of concurrent users.
